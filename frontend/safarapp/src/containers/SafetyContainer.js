                Share your itinerary with family or friends before you leave, including details of your flights, accommodation, and key contact numbers.
                Regularly check in with someone you trust, providing updates on your whereabouts and any changes to your plans. Use messaging apps or social media to stay in touch, but avoid sharing detailed information about your location publicly. In case of an emergency, having someone aware of your schedule can expedite assistance and ensure your safety.

                Always be mindful of your surroundings, especially in unfamiliar areas. Avoid using headphones or other distractions that can reduce your awareness. Stick to well-lit and populated areas, especially at night. Be cautious of anyone acting suspiciously or following you. If you feel uncomfortable, move to a safer location and seek help. Trust your instincts; if something feels off, it's better to be cautious and alert someone.
                 Inform someone you trust about your whereabouts and schedule, especially if traveling alone. Use a map or GPS discreetly to avoid looking lost or vulnerable. Avoid sharing your location or travel plans on social media in real-time. Be aware of common scams in the area and how to avoid them.
